SELECT * FROM constraint_violations ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Get constraint health status
SELECT * FROM get_constraint_health_status();

-- Get violation summary
SELECT * FROM get_constraint_violation_summary(7);

-- Get impact analysis
SELECT * FROM generate_constraint_impact_analysis();

-- Get dashboard data
SELECT get_constraint_monitoring_dashboard();
```

### **Emergency Procedures**

1. **Critical Constraint Failure**
   - Disable constraint temporarily if needed
   - Investigate root cause
   - Implement fix
   - Re-enable constraint

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Review constraint logic
   - Optimize queries
   - Add indexes if needed
   - Monitor performance

3. **Data Integrity Issues**
   - Review constraint violations
   - Clean up invalid data
   - Update constraint logic if needed
   - Monitor for recurrence
