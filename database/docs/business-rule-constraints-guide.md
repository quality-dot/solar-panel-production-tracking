## 🏭 Manufacturing Workflow Constraints

### Panel Workflow Progression

#### `check_workflow_progression`
**Purpose**: Ensures panels follow the correct production workflow states  
**Enforcement**: Prevents invalid status transitions and ensures workflow completion

```sql
CHECK (
    (status = 'PENDING' AND current_station_id IS NULL) OR
    (status = 'IN_PROGRESS' AND current_station_id IS NOT NULL) OR
    (status = 'COMPLETED' AND current_station_id IS NOT NULL AND 
     station_1_completed_at IS NOT NULL AND
     station_2_completed_at IS NOT NULL AND
     station_3_completed_at IS NOT NULL AND
     station_4_completed_at IS NOT NULL) OR
    (status = 'FAILED' AND current_station_id IS NOT NULL) OR
    (status = 'REWORK' AND current_station_id IS NOT NULL)
)
```

**Business Impact**: 
- Prevents panels from being marked complete without proper station progression
- Ensures failed panels are properly routed to rework
- Maintains workflow integrity across all production lines

#### `check_station_completion_sequence`
**Purpose**: Ensures station completion follows chronological order

     (station_2_completed_at IS NULL OR station_2_completed_at >= station_1_completed_at)) OR
    (station_2_completed_at IS NOT NULL AND 
     (station_3_completed_at IS NULL OR station_3_completed_at >= station_2_completed_at)) OR
    (station_3_completed_at IS NOT NULL AND 
     (station_4_completed_at IS NULL OR station_4_completed_at >= station_3_completed_at))

        SELECT 1 FROM inspections i2 
        WHERE i2.panel_id = panel_id AND i2.station_id = 1 AND i2.result = 'PASS'
    )) OR
    (station_id = 3 AND EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM inspections i2 
        WHERE i2.panel_id = panel_id AND i2.station_id = 2 AND i2.result = 'PASS'
