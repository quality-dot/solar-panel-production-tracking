## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [securityMetrics, setSecurityMetrics] = useState<SecurityMetrics>(mockSecurityMetrics);
const [complianceStatus, setComplianceStatus] = useState<ComplianceStatus>(mockComplianceStatus);
const [manufacturingSecurity, setManufacturingSecurity] = useState<ManufacturingSecurity>(mockManufacturingSecurity);
const [recentEvents, setRecentEvents] = useState<SecurityEvent[]>(mockRecentEvents);
const [securityAlerts, setSecurityAlerts] = useState<SecurityAlert[]>([]);
const [dashboardConfig, setDashboardConfig] = useState<DashboardConfig | null>(null);
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
const [lastUpdated, setLastUpdated] = useState(new Date());
const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState<'connected' | 'disconnected' | 'error'>('disconnected');
```

### Real-time Updates
- **WebSocket Connection**: Automatic connection management with reconnection logic
