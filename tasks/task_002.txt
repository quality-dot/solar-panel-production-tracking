## Dependencies
- Task 1 must be complete (Project Setup & Infrastructure)

## Next Steps
1. Begin with system architecture design (2.1)
2. Design database schema (2.2)
3. Define API specifications (2.3)
4. Plan security architecture (2.4)
5. Plan performance and scalability (2.5)
6. Design integration architecture (2.6)

## Notes
- Focus on scalability for handling 10,000+ documents per user
- Ensure security compliance with GDPR and HIPAA
- Plan for 99.9% uptime requirements
- Consider performance requirements (search < 2 seconds, upload < 30 seconds)
- Total estimated time: 19-25 days
