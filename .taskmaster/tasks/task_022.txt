## 22.4: Encryption Validation and Performance Testing - DONE
- ✅ Comprehensive encryption testing framework (backend/utils/encryptionTester.js)
- ✅ 4 test categories: Algorithm Validation, Key Management, Performance, Security Validation
- ✅ Algorithm validation: AES-256-GCM strength, encryption/decryption round trips, hash function validation
- ✅ Key management testing: Key generation, storage, rotation validation
- ✅ Performance testing: Single field, batch processing, concurrent operations, memory recovery
- ✅ Security validation: Randomness quality, salt/IV validation, load testing
- ✅ Performance thresholds: Max 10ms per field, 1000+ ops/sec throughput
- ✅ Load testing: 100 concurrent operations, batch sizes up to 1000
- ✅ Memory recovery testing under stress conditions
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (backend/test/test-encryption-framework.js)
- ✅ Framework identifies security issues and provides actionable recommendations
