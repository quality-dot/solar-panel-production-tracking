# Task ID: 22
# Title: Security and Audit Trail Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive security and audit logging with local-first approach, planning for future cloud migration
# Details:
Task 22 has been broken down into 16 micro-tasks across 4 phases. This is a comprehensive security and audit trail implementation that will be built incrementally with local-first approach, planning for future cloud migration. PHASE 1: CORE LOGGING & ENCRYPTION (Week 1) - 22.1: Advanced Logging with Winston.js (2 days) - 22.2: Basic Data Encryption (2 days) PHASE 2: SECURITY MONITORING (Week 2) - 22.3: Event Collection System (2 days) - 22.4: Basic Security Dashboard (2 days) PHASE 3: THREAT DETECTION (Week 3) - 22.5: Basic Anomaly Detection (2 days) - 22.6: Threat Intelligence Integration (2 days) PHASE 4: COMPLIANCE & TESTING (Week 4) - 22.7: Basic Compliance Framework (2 days) - 22.8: Performance & Documentation (2 days) Total Duration: 4 weeks Total Micro-Tasks: 16 Approach: Local-first development, future cloud migration planned Complexity: High (but broken into manageable pieces) Dependencies: Minimal between phases, parallel development possible
