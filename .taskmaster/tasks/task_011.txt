# Task ID: 11
# Title: Rework Flow Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement rework routing and re-entry workflow
# Details:
Create rework system that routes failed panels to rework station, enables re-entry at point of failure (not Station 1), automatic queue reinsertion on rescan, failure reason tracking, and maintains process cycle history.

# Test Strategy:
Rework routing tests, re-entry point tests, queue management tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Rework Routing and Queue Management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build rework routing system for failed panels
### Details:
Create rework routing logic that directs failed panels to rework station, implements queue management for rework items, tracks failure reasons, and maintains separate rework queues per failure type.

## 2. Build Re-entry Point Determination Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create system to determine correct re-entry station after rework
### Details:
Implement logic to determine re-entry station based on failure point (not Station 1), validate rework completion, automatically route to appropriate next station, and handle special cases for multi-station failures.

## 3. Create Process Cycle History Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive rework history and tracking
### Details:
Build process cycle history that tracks all attempts, failure reasons, rework actions taken, completion times, and maintains complete audit trail for each panel through multiple rework cycles.
