# Task ID: 10
# Title: Manufacturing Order (MO) Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement MO creation, tracking, and management functionality
# Details:
Create system for MO creation with panel type and quantity, BOM verification, progress tracking with alerts at 50 panels remaining, automatic closure, and historical data access.

# Test Strategy:
MO lifecycle tests, progress tracking tests, alert system tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement MO Creation and BOM Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build MO creation system with validation
### Details:
Create MO creation interface, validate panel type against available configurations, BOM verification against barcode templates, quantity validation, automatic MO number generation, and initial status setup.

## 2. Build Progress Tracking and Alert System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement real-time MO progress monitoring with alerts
### Details:
Create progress calculation based on completed panels, implement alert system for 50 panels remaining, real-time progress updates, completion percentage tracking, and bottleneck identification for MO workflow.

## 3. Implement Automatic MO Closure Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build automated MO completion and closure system
### Details:
Create automatic MO closure when all panels completed, generate completion reports, calculate final statistics (pass/fail rates, rework counts), archive completed MO data, and trigger pallet finalization processes.

## 4. Create Historical Data and Reporting Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build MO history and reporting functionality
### Details:
Implement historical MO data access, F/B panel reporting by MO, production metrics calculation, export capabilities for MO reports, data retention management for 7-year compliance, and search/filter functionality.

## 5. End-to-End Workflow Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test complete manufacturing workflows
### Details:
Conduct end-to-end testing of complete panel workflows from barcode scan through all stations to completion. Test dual-line operations and cross-line scenarios.

## 6. Offline/Online Transition Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Validate offline functionality and sync
### Details:
Test offline operations, data persistence, and synchronization when connectivity is restored. Validate conflict resolution and data integrity.

## 7. Performance and Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Validate system performance under load
### Details:
Test system performance with 8 concurrent stations, high-volume panel processing, and extended operation periods. Validate response times and resource usage.

## 8. User Acceptance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Conduct comprehensive user testing
### Details:
Perform user acceptance testing with actual manufacturing personnel. Validate user interface usability, workflow efficiency, and error handling.

## 9. Compliance and Security Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Validate compliance requirements and security
### Details:
Verify compliance with manufacturing standards, data retention requirements (7 years), and security requirements. Conduct security vulnerability assessment.
