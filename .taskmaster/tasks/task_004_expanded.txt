# Task ID: 4
# Title: Barcode Processing and Validation System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement barcode parsing, validation, and line assignment logic
# Details:
Create system to parse CRSYYFBPP##### barcode format, validate components, determine panel type, and automatically assign to correct production line (Line 1: 36,40,60,72; Line 2: 144).

# Test Strategy:
Barcode parsing tests, validation logic tests, line assignment tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Core Barcode Parsing Engine [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement CRSYYFBPP##### format parsing and component extraction
### Details:
Create barcode parsing utilities that break down the CRSYYFBPP##### format into components (company prefix, year, factory, batch, panel type, sequence). Include comprehensive validation for each component and error handling for malformed barcodes.

## 2. Barcode Validation and Business Rules [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement comprehensive validation logic for all barcode components
### Details:
Create validation system that checks company prefix (CRS), year ranges, valid factory codes (W/B/T), batch codes (T/W/B), panel types (36/40/60/72/144), and sequence number format. Include business rule validation and detailed error reporting.

## 3. Line Assignment Logic and Routing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement automatic line assignment based on panel type
### Details:
Create line assignment system that automatically routes panels to Line 1 (36,40,60,72) or Line 2 (144) based on panel type. Include station range assignment and validation of line assignments.

## 4. Manual Override and Correction System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement manual specification override for damaged/incorrect barcodes
### Details:
Create manual override system allowing correction of nominal wattage, panel type, construction type (bifacial/monofacial), frame color, production year, and quality grade. Include validation, audit trail, and UI helper functions.

## 5. RESTful API Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive API endpoints for barcode processing
### Details:
Implement REST API with endpoints for barcode processing, validation, line assignment, manual specification, batch processing, and specification options. Include proper error handling and response standardization.

## 6. Comprehensive Test Suite [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create extensive test coverage for all barcode processing components
### Details:
Implement unit tests for parsing, validation, line assignment, manual overrides, and API endpoints. Include real-world manufacturing scenarios, edge cases, and integration test helpers.

## 7. Database Integration Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: Task 1 (Database Schema)
### Description: Create database service layer for barcode-related operations
### Details:
Implement database service layer that handles panel creation from barcodes, barcode uniqueness validation, panel lookup by barcode, and integration with manufacturing orders. Include proper transaction handling and error recovery.

## 8. Barcode Generation Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create barcode generation utilities for testing and MO setup
### Details:
Implement barcode generation utilities for creating valid test barcodes, MO-specific barcode ranges, and validation of manufacturing order barcode templates. Include bulk generation capabilities.

## 9. Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize barcode processing for production floor performance requirements
### Details:
Optimize barcode processing to meet <2 second response time requirement. Implement caching for validation rules, connection pooling optimization, and performance monitoring. Include load testing for 8 concurrent stations.

## 10. Integration with Manufacturing Orders [pending]
### Dependencies: Task 10 (MO Management)
### Description: Integrate barcode processing with manufacturing order validation
### Details:
Create MO integration that validates barcodes against active manufacturing orders, checks panel type consistency, validates sequence ranges, and provides MO-specific barcode generation. Include automatic MO progress tracking.

## 11. Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Create comprehensive error handling for network failures, database connection issues, invalid barcode scenarios, and system recovery. Include graceful degradation, retry mechanisms, and detailed error logging.

## 12. Monitoring and Analytics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement barcode processing monitoring and analytics
### Details:
Create monitoring system for barcode scan rates, validation success rates, error patterns, and performance metrics. Include dashboards for production floor monitoring and troubleshooting tools.

## 13. Documentation and Training Materials [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for barcode system
### Details:
Create technical documentation, API documentation, troubleshooting guides, and training materials for operators. Include barcode format examples, common error scenarios, and best practices.
