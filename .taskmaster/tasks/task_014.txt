# Task ID: 14
# Title: Barcode Scanning Integration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement camera-based barcode scanning for station tablets
# Details:
Integrate html5-qrcode or QuaggaJS for barcode scanning using tablet cameras, implement audio/visual feedback for successful scans, handle scan errors, and provide manual entry fallback.

# Test Strategy:
Barcode scanning tests, camera integration tests, fallback mechanism tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Barcode Scanning Libraries [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure html5-qrcode and other necessary barcode scanning libraries for the frontend
### Details:
Install html5-qrcode, quagga, or similar libraries for real camera-based barcode scanning. Configure TypeScript types and ensure compatibility with the PWA setup.

## 2. Create Real Camera Integration Component [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement actual camera access and barcode scanning using the installed libraries
### Details:
Replace the mock scanning in PanelScan.tsx with real camera integration. Implement camera device selection, real-time video feed, and actual barcode detection using the html5-qrcode library.

## 3. Implement Barcode Validation and Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Connect frontend scanning to backend validation and processing
### Details:
Integrate the frontend barcode scanning with the backend BarcodeScannerService. Implement real-time validation, error handling, and processing of scanned barcodes including the CRSYYFBPP##### format validation.

## 4. Add Audio/Visual Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement real audio and visual feedback for successful scans and errors
### Details:
Add real audio feedback (beeps, tones) and visual feedback (color changes, animations) for successful scans, errors, and processing states. Integrate with the backend feedback system.

## 5. Create Station Tablet Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate barcode scanning with station workflow and tablet interface
### Details:
Connect the barcode scanning to the station workflow engine. Implement station-specific scanning interfaces, workflow progression, and integration with the existing station criteria and validation systems.

## 6. Implement Offline Scanning and Sync [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add offline barcode scanning capabilities with sync when connection is restored
### Details:
Implement offline barcode scanning using IndexedDB storage. Add sync functionality to upload scanned data when connection is restored, integrating with the existing offline sync system.

## 7. Add Testing and Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive testing for the barcode scanning integration
### Details:
Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for the barcode scanning system. Test camera integration, barcode validation, error handling, and offline functionality.
