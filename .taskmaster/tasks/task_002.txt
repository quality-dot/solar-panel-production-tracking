# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Node.js Express backend with core middleware and project structure
# Details:
Initialize Node.js project with Express framework, configure CORS, authentication middleware, logging, error handling, and establish project structure with proper separation of concerns.

# Test Strategy:
API endpoint tests, middleware validation tests, error handling tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Backend Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up manufacturing-optimized folder structure for solar panel tracking system
### Details:
Create backend/ directory with controllers/, services/, middleware/, routes/, utils/, config/, and server.js. Structure optimized for 4-station workflow, barcode processing, and real-time manufacturing operations.

## 2. Setup Environment Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure environment variables and app configuration for production manufacturing
### Details:
Create .env.example, config/environment.js, and config/database.js files. Configure for development, production, and test environments. Include settings for 8 concurrent stations, PostgreSQL connection pooling, and manufacturing-specific timeouts.

## 3. Initialize Express Server Foundation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create basic Express server setup with ES6 modules
### Details:
Create server.js with Express initialization, ES6 module imports, basic error handling, graceful shutdown, and preparation for middleware stack. Configure for production floor reliability with proper logging.

## 4. Configure Security Middleware Stack [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up production-grade security middleware for manufacturing environment
### Details:
Configure helmet for security headers, CORS for PWA tablet access, express-rate-limit for station protection, and body parsing middleware. Optimize for 8 concurrent tablet stations with proper security for production floor.

## 5. Setup Logging and Monitoring Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure comprehensive logging for production floor operations
### Details:
Set up Morgan for request logging, create custom manufacturing logger, configure log rotation, and add performance monitoring. Include station-specific logging for barcode scans, pass/fail actions, and error tracking.

## 6. Create Global Error Handling Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement robust error handling for manufacturing reliability
### Details:
Create comprehensive error handling middleware with different error types (validation, database, authentication), proper HTTP status codes, and manufacturing-specific error responses. Include error logging and recovery strategies for production floor operations.

## 7. Setup PostgreSQL Connection Pool [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure optimized database connection for concurrent stations
### Details:
Set up pg-pool with configuration for 8 concurrent stations, connection pooling optimization, health checks, and reconnection logic. Use existing database config and implement connection monitoring for production reliability.

## 8. Design RESTful API Route Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive API routing architecture for manufacturing workflow
### Details:
Design and implement route structure for /api/v1/stations, /api/v1/panels, /api/v1/manufacturing-orders, /api/v1/inspections, /api/v1/pallets. Include proper HTTP methods, parameter validation, and manufacturing workflow-specific endpoints.

## 9. Create Input Validation Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement validation for barcode processing and manufacturing data
### Details:
Set up express-validator or Joi for validating barcode formats (CRSYYFBPP#####), station data, panel information, and pass/fail criteria. Include manufacturing-specific validation rules and error responses optimized for tablet interfaces.

## 10. Implement Response Standardization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create consistent API response format for all endpoints
### Details:
Design and implement standardized response format with success/error status, data payload, metadata, and pagination. Include manufacturing-specific response fields for station status, real-time updates, and offline sync capabilities.

## 11. Create Database Health Check Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement monitoring endpoints for production floor reliability
### Details:
Create /health, /status, and /ready endpoints for monitoring database connectivity, server health, and readiness checks. Include production floor-specific metrics like active stations, connection pool status, and system performance indicators.

## 12. Setup Development Scripts and Testing Framework [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure development environment and basic testing setup
### Details:
Create npm scripts for development (nodemon), production, testing, and database operations. Set up basic test framework foundation for API testing. Include scripts for manufacturing environment deployment and monitoring.
