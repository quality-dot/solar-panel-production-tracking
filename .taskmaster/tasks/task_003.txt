# Test Strategy:
Authentication flow tests, authorization permission tests, security vulnerability tests

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup JWT Libraries and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure JWT dependencies and environment setup
### Details:
Install jsonwebtoken and bcryptjs packages, configure JWT secrets in environment variables, set up token expiration times (access: 15min, refresh: 7days), and create JWT utility functions for sign/verify operations.

## 2. Create User Model and Password Hashing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement user data model with secure password handling
### Details:
Create User model with fields (id, username, email, password_hash, role, station_assignments, created_at, last_login), implement bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds (12), and create password validation utilities.

## 3. Build Login/Logout API Endpoints [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create authentication endpoints with proper validation
### Details:
Implement POST /auth/login with username/password validation, create logout endpoint that invalidates tokens, implement refresh token endpoint, add input validation and sanitization, and return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

## 4. Define Role System and Permissions Matrix [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive role definitions and permission structure
### Details:
Define 4 roles: STATION_INSPECTOR (station operations), PRODUCTION_SUPERVISOR (monitoring, basic admin), QC_MANAGER (quality reports, advanced admin), SYSTEM_ADMIN (full access). Create permissions matrix for API endpoints, UI components, and data access levels.

## 5. Create Authorization Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build middleware for route protection and permission checking
### Details:
Create JWT verification middleware, role-based route protection middleware, permission checking functions, station assignment validation for inspectors, and authorization error handling with proper HTTP responses.

## 6. Implement Station Assignment Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create station assignment system for inspector users
### Details:
Build station assignment model linking users to specific stations/lines, implement assignment validation (inspector can only access assigned stations), create assignment management API endpoints, and add assignment checking in station workflows.

## 7. Implement Security Protection Features [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add rate limiting, brute force protection, and security headers
### Details:
Implement rate limiting (10 login attempts per 15 minutes), brute force protection with account lockout, secure HTTP headers with helmet.js, CSRF protection for state-changing operations, and IP-based blocking for repeated failed attempts.

## 8. Build Session Management and Audit Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive session handling and security audit trail
### Details:
Implement session timeout handling (4 hours idle), multi-device session management, session invalidation on password change, security audit logging (login/logout/failed attempts), and session monitoring dashboard for admins.

## 9. Create Frontend Authentication Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build React components for authentication and role-based UI
### Details:
Create login form component with validation, implement token storage in localStorage/sessionStorage, build role-based component rendering, create authentication context/hooks, implement automatic token refresh, and add logout functionality with session cleanup.
