## Implementation Details

### Pattern Detection Algorithm
```javascript
detectPatterns(events, timeRange) {
  const patterns = {
    frequency: this.analyzeFrequency(events),
    correlation: this.analyzeCorrelations(events),
    sequences: this.analyzeSequences(events),
    anomalies: this.detectAnomalies(events),
    trends: this.analyzeTrends(events, timeRange)
  };
  return patterns;
}
```

### Anomaly Detection Logic
```javascript
// Frequency anomalies: 3x above average
if (count > avgFrequency * 3) {
  anomalies.frequencyAnomalies.push({
    eventType,
    count,
    expected: avgFrequency,
    anomaly: 'high_frequency'
  });
}

// Time anomalies: late night activity (>5 events 12AM-6AM)
if ((hourNum >= 0 && hourNum <= 5) && count > 5) {
  anomalies.timeAnomalies.push({
    hour: hourNum,
    count,
    anomaly: 'late_night_activity'
  });
}

// User anomalies: 5x above average activity
if (count > avgUserActivity * 5) {
  anomalies.userAnomalies.push({
    userId,
    count,
    expected: avgUserActivity,
    anomaly: 'high_user_activity'
  });
}
```

### Risk Assessment Algorithm
```javascript
calculateRiskScore(anomalies) {
  let riskScore = 0;
  
  // Frequency anomalies: 10 points each
  if (anomalies.frequencyAnomalies) {
    riskScore += anomalies.frequencyAnomalies.length * 10;
  }
  
  // Time anomalies: 15 points each
  if (anomalies.timeAnomalies) {
    riskScore += anomalies.timeAnomalies.length * 15;
  }
  
  // User anomalies: 20 points each
  if (anomalies.userAnomalies) {
    riskScore += anomalies.userAnomalies.length * 20;
  }
  
  // Severity anomalies: 25 points each
  if (anomalies.severityAnomalies) {
    riskScore += anomalies.severityAnomalies.length * 25;
  }
  
  return Math.min(riskScore, 100);
}
```

### Time Interval Generation
```javascript
createTimeIntervals(timeRange) {
  const now = new Date();
  const intervals = [];
  
  switch (timeRange) {
    case '1h':
      // 10-minute intervals for last hour
      for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        const start = new Date(now.getTime() - (60 - i * 10) * 60 * 1000);
        const end = new Date(now.getTime() - (60 - (i + 1) * 10) * 60 * 1000);
        intervals.push({
          name: `${i * 10}-${(i + 1) * 10}min ago`,
          start, end
        });
      }
      break;
      
    case '24h':
      // Hourly intervals for last 24 hours
      for (let i = 0; i < 24; i++) {
        const start = new Date(now.getTime() - (24 - i) * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        const end = new Date(now.getTime() - (24 - (i + 1)) * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        intervals.push({
          name: `${i + 1}h ago`,
          start, end
        });
      }
      break;
      
    case '7d':
      // Daily intervals for last 7 days
      for (let i = 0; i < 7; i++) {
        const start = new Date(now.getTime() - (7 - i) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        const end = new Date(now.getTime() - (7 - (i + 1)) * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
        intervals.push({
          name: `${i + 1}d ago`,
          start, end
        });
      }
      break;
  }
  
  return intervals;
}
```
