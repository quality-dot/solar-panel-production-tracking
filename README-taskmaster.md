# TaskMaster AI - Paperless Project

This project has been initialized with TaskMaster AI, a powerful task management system for AI-driven development.

## What is TaskMaster AI?

TaskMaster AI is an intelligent task management system that helps you:
- Break down complex projects into manageable tasks
- Generate tasks from Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Manage task dependencies and priorities
- Integrate with AI assistants like Cursor for seamless development

## Getting Started

### 1. ✅ PRD Created
Your Product Requirements Document has been created at `scripts/prd.txt` with comprehensive requirements for the Paperless document management system.

### 2. ✅ Tasks Generated
TaskMaster AI has analyzed your PRD and generated 12 comprehensive tasks with detailed subtasks, dependencies, and priorities.

### 3. Next Steps
- Review the generated tasks in `tasks.json`
- Begin working on Task 2: Technical Architecture Design
- Use the individual task files in the `tasks/` directory for detailed guidance

## Current Project Status

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- **Task 1**: Initialize Project (Complete)

### ⏳ Next Priority Tasks
- **Task 2**: Technical Architecture Design (Pending - High Priority)
- **Task 3**: Backend Development - Core Infrastructure (Pending - High Priority)
- **Task 4**: Document Upload & Storage System (Pending - High Priority)

### 📋 Full Task Overview

1. Project Setup & Infrastructure ✅
2. Technical Architecture Design ⏳
3. Backend Development - Core Infrastructure ⏳
4. Document Upload & Storage System ⏳
5. Document Organization & Categorization ⏳
6. Search & Retrieval Engine ⏳
7. Web Frontend Development ⏳
8. Security & Backup Systems ⏳
9. Mobile Application Development ⏳
10. Testing & Quality Assurance ⏳
11. Deployment & DevOps ⏳
12. Documentation & User Training ⏳

## Using with Cursor AI

TaskMaster AI is now integrated and ready to work with Cursor through MCP (Model Context Protocol). You can ask the AI to:

- **Show next task**: "What's the next task I should work on?"
- **Task details**: "Show me details for task 2"
- **Update status**: "Mark task 2 as in-progress"
- **Expand tasks**: "Break down task 2 into more detailed subtasks"
- **Dependencies**: "What tasks depend on task 2?"

### Example Cursor Commands

```
"What's the next task I should work on?"
"Show me the details for task 2: Technical Architecture Design"
"Mark task 2 as in-progress and show me the subtasks"
"What are the dependencies for task 3?"
"Update task 2 with progress notes"
```

## Task Management Commands

TaskMaster AI provides several ways to manage your tasks:

- **List all tasks**: `task-master list`
- **Show next task**: `task-master next`
- **Update task status**: `task-master set-status --id=2 --status=in-progress`
- **Expand complex tasks**: `task-master expand --id=2 --num=4`
- **Show task details**: `task-master show 2`

## Configuration

### API Keys
To use TaskMaster AI with external AI models, you'll need to configure API keys. You can:

1. Add them to a `.env` file in your project root (copy from `env.example`)
2. Configure them in your MCP configuration (`.cursor/mcp.json`)
3. Use the `task-master models --setup` command

### Supported AI Providers
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT)
- Google (Gemini)
- Perplexity
- And many more

## Project Timeline

Based on your PRD, the project is planned for a 6-month development timeline:

- **Phase 1**: Core Infrastructure & Basic Upload (2 months)
- **Phase 2**: Organization & Search (2 months)
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features & Mobile (2 months)

## Next Steps

1. **Review Tasks**: Examine the generated tasks in `tasks.json` and individual task files
2. **Start Architecture**: Begin with Task 2 (Technical Architecture Design)
3. **Set Up Environment**: Prepare your development environment for backend development
4. **Track Progress**: Use TaskMaster AI to update task statuses as you work

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Issues
If you encounter MCP server errors:
- Check that TaskMaster AI is properly installed
- Verify your MCP configuration in `.cursor/mcp.json`
- Ensure API keys are properly configured

### CLI Commands Not Working
If CLI commands fail:
- Verify Node.js and npm are installed
- Check that TaskMaster AI is in your package.json dependencies
- Try running commands with `npx task-master` instead of `task-master`
