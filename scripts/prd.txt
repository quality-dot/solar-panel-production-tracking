  - Backend API development
  - Basic document upload and storage
  - Simple web interface
- **Phase 2**: Organization & Search (2 months)
  - Document categorization system
  - Search functionality
  - User management
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Features & Mobile (2 months)
  - Mobile app development
  - Advanced security features
  - Performance optimization

## Risks & Mitigation
- **OCR Accuracy Risk**: Low-quality scans may result in poor text recognition
  - *Mitigation*: Implement multiple OCR engines and user correction tools
- **Storage Cost Risk**: Large document volumes may increase storage costs
  - *Mitigation*: Implement intelligent compression and tiered storage
- **Security Risk**: Sensitive documents require enterprise-grade security
  - *Mitigation*: Regular security audits and compliance certifications

## Next Steps
