‚úÖ **Task 10:** Testing & Quality Assurance (4 subtasks)  
‚úÖ **Task 11:** Deployment & DevOps (4 subtasks)  
‚úÖ **Task 12:** Documentation & User Training (4 subtasks)  

## Impact Analysis

### Timeline Impact
- **Current Estimate:** 6 months
- **With Expansion:** 7-8 months
- **Reason:** More granular tasks provide better estimation accuracy and reduce risk

### Risk Reduction
- **Better Estimation:** Smaller tasks are easier to estimate accurately
- **Progress Tracking:** More granular progress monitoring
- **Resource Allocation:** Better understanding of skill requirements
- **Dependency Management:** Clearer task dependencies

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action:** Expand Task 2 (Technical Architecture Design) as it's your next priority
2. **Week 1:** Expand Tasks 4 and 5 (Document systems)
3. **Week 2:** Expand Tasks 6 and 7 (Search and Frontend)
4. **Week 3:** Expand Task 8 (Security systems)

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Architecture & Planning (Tasks 2-3)
- Focus on getting the foundation right
- Detailed technical specifications
- Technology stack decisions

### Phase 2: Core Systems (Tasks 4-6)
- Document processing pipeline
- Search infrastructure
- Basic functionality

### Phase 3: User Interface (Tasks 7-8)
- Web and mobile interfaces
- Security implementation
- User experience

### Phase 4: Quality & Deployment (Tasks 9-12)
- Testing and optimization
